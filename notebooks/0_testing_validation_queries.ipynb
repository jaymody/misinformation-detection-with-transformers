       "       \"content\": \"Exposed: Child labour behind smart phone and electric car batteries Major electronics brands, including Apple, Samsung and Sony, are failing to do basic checks to ensure that cobalt mined by child labourers has not been used in their products, said Amnesty International and Afrewatch in a report published today. , traces the sale of cobalt, used in lithium-ion batteries, from mines where children as young as seven and adults work in perilous conditions. \\u201cThe glamourous shop displays and marketing of state of the art technologies are a stark contrast to the children carrying bags of rocks, and miners in narrow manmade tunnels risking permanent lung damage,\\u201d said Mark Dummett, Business & Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International. \\u201cMillions of people enjoy the benefits of new technologies but rarely ask how they are made. It is high time the big brands took some responsibility for the mining of the raw materials that make their lucrative products.\\u201d The report documents how traders buy cobalt from areas where child labour is rife and sell it to Congo Dongfang Mining (CDM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese mineral giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd (Huayou Cobalt). Amnesty International\\u2019s investigation uses investor documents to show how Huayou Cobalt and its subsidiary CDM process the cobalt before selling it to three battery component manufacturers in China and South Korea. In turn, they sell to battery makers who claim to supply technology and car companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, Daimler and Volkswagen. Amnesty International contacted 16 multinationals who were listed as customers of the battery manufacturers listed as sourcing processed ore from Huayou Cobalt. One company admitted the connection, while four were unable to say for certain whether they were buying cobalt from the DRC or Huayou Cobalt. Six said they were investigating the claims. Five denied sourcing cobalt from via Huayou Cobalt, though they are listed as customers in the company documents of battery manufacturers. Two multinationals denied sourcing cobalt from DRC. Crucially, none provided enough details to independently verify where the cobalt in their products came from. \\u201cIt is a major paradox of the digital era that some of the world\\u2019s richest, most innovative companies are able to market incredibly sophisticated devices without being required to show where they source raw materials for their components,\\u201d said Emmanuel Umpula, Afrewatch ( \\u201cThe abuses in mines remain out of sight and out of mind because in today\\u2019s global marketplace consumers have no idea about the conditions at the mine, factory, and assembly line. We found that traders are buying cobalt without asking questions about how and where it was mined.\\u201d The DRC produces at least 50% of the world\\u2019s cobalt. One of the largest mineral processors in the country is Huayou Cobalt subsidiary CDM. Huayou Cobalt gets more than 40% of its cobalt from DRC. Miners working in areas from which CDM buys cobalt face the risk of long-term health damage and a high risk of fatal accidents. At least 80 artisanal miners died underground in southern DRC between September 2014 and December 2015 alone. The true figure is unknown as many accidents go unrecorded and bodies are left buried in the rubble. Amnesty International researchers also found that the vast majority of miners spend long hours every day working with cobalt without the most basic of protective equipment, such as gloves, work clothes or facemasks to protect them from lung or skin disease. Children told Amnesty International they worked for up to 12 hours a day in the mines, carrying heavy loads to earn between one and two dollars a day. In 2014 approximately 40,000 children worked in mines across southern DRC, many of them mining cobalt, according to UNICEF. Paul, a 14-year-old orphan, started mining at the age of 12. He told researchers that prolonged time underground made him constantly ill: \\u201cI would spend 24 hours down in the tunnels. I arrived in the morning and would leave the following morning ... I had to relieve myself down in the tunnels \\u2026 My foster mother planned to send me to school, but my foster father was against it, he exploited me by making me work in the mine.\\u201d \\u201cThe dangers to health and safety make mining one of the worst forms of child labour. Companies whose global profits total $125 billion cannot credibly claim that they are unable to check where key minerals in their productions come from,\\u201d said Mark Dummett. \\u201cMining the basic materials that power an electric car or a smartphone should be a source of prosperity for miners in DRC. The reality is that it is a back-breaking life of misery for almost no money. Big brands have the power to change this.\\u201d Following the supply chain \\u2013 corporate shame Amnesty International and Afrewatch researchers spoke to 87 current and former cobalt miners, 17 of them children, from five mine sites in southern DRC in April and May 2015. They also interviewed 18 cobalt traders and followed vehicles of miners and traders as they carried cobalt ore from mines to markets where larger companies buy the ore. The largest of them is Huayou Cobalt\\u2019s Congolese subsidiary CDM. Huayou Cobalt supplies cobalt to three lithium-ion battery component manufacturers Ningbo Shanshan and Tianjin Bamo from China and L&F Materials from South Korea. These three battery component manufacturers bought more than US$90 million worth of cobalt from Huayou Cobalt in 2013. Amnesty International then contacted 16 multinational consumer brands listed as direct or indirect customers of the three battery component manufacturers. None said they had been in touch with Huayou Cobalt or traced where the cobalt in their products had come from prior to Amnesty International\\u2019s contact. The report shows that companies along the cobalt supply chain are failing to address human rights risks arising in their supply chain. Today there is no regulation of the global cobalt market. Cobalt does not fall under existing \\u201cconflict minerals\\u201d rules in the USA, which cover gold, coltan/tantalum, tin and tungsten mined in DRC. \\u201cMany of these multinationals say they have a zero tolerance policy for child labour. But this promise is not worth the paper it is written when the companies are not investigating their suppliers. Their claim is simply not credible,\\u201d said Mark Dummett. \\u201cWithout laws that require companies to check and publicly disclose information about where they source minerals and their suppliers, companies can continue to benefit from human rights abuses. Governments must put an end to this lack of transparency, which allows companies to profit from misery.\\u201d Amnesty International and Afrewatch are calling on multinational companies who use lithium-ion batteries in their products to conduct human rights due diligence, investigate whether the cobalt is extracted under hazardous conditions or with child labour, and be more transparent about their suppliers. The organizations are also calling on China to require Chinese extractive companies operating overseas to investigate their supply chains and address human rights abuses in their operations. The organizations say Huayou Cobalt should confirm who is involved in mining and trading its cobalt (and where) and make sure it is not buying cobalt mined by child labour or in dangerous conditions. \\u201cCompanies must not simply discontinue a trading relationship with a supplier or embargo DRC cobalt once human rights risks have been identified in the supply chain. They must take remedial action on the harm suffered by people whose human rights were abused,\\u201d said Mark Dummett.

The announcement came as the London Metal Exchange (LME) launched an initiative under which it could ban or delist brands that are not responsibly sourced by 2022 to help root out metal tainted by child labor or corruption. Andreas Wendt, BMW board member responsible for procurement, told a briefing in Paris that the new supply of cobalt would be used in the carmaker\\u2019s next generation of EVs in 2020. A spokesman for mining and trading firm Glencore told Reuters his company would supply BMW with cobalt from its Australian Murrin Murrin mine, which last year produced 2,900 tonnes of cobalt.

       "       \"content\": \"Cobalt mining: dark side of the electric car revolution Electric cars are causing a boom in cobalt mining. But most of the resource is mined in dangerous conditions in the DRC. One of the big changes facing the global transportation industry is electrification. Big corporations and car manufacturers are ditching combustion engines, with Toyota saying it will have an electrified or hybrid version of all vehicles by 2025. But there is a dark side to this revolution. Cobalt is one of the key ingredients added in electric batteries, and more than half of it is currently mined in the Amnesty says children as young as seven work in dangerous conditions in Congo cobalt mines. \\\"At the present time, you'd have to say that there isn't a lot of regulation around the mining of cobalt,\\\" says Wendt thinks recent international scandals in the car industry have put pressure on car manufacturers to ethically source the materials needed for their cars. \\\"We're seeing more and more ... pressure from society to ensure that these commodities are ethically sourced ... A very big issue is going to be where this cobalt will come from, and hence companies are looking to source cobalt outside of the DRC as much as possible,\\\" Wendt says. With 54 percent of cobalt currently coming from the Congo, that goal is still a long way off. Meanwhile, Wendt says demand for cobalt is estimated to grow by a staggering 9000 percent in the next two decades. This might drive the price of the resource up to the point that electric cars will become too expensive to make economic sense. \\\"The commodities themselves have to come down in price and that automatically means that more needs to be found,\\\" Wendt says. \\\"In the case of cobalt, of course we're also talking about potential substitution ... actually reducing the amount of cobalt that's currently consumed in these typical batteries.\\\" earthrise travels to China and the US to see how the world's environmental leadership is changing hands.

The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter in the world. Major brands are exploiting garment workers and harming the environment in the production of shoes and clothing. However, there has been a rise in sustainable fashion brands, making everything from sportswear to underwear who are putting people and the planet before profit. As food & drink prices continue to rise across the world, it is often the producers and workers who are losing out to big corporations. We shine a light on the food sovereignty movement pushing for a fairer food system that supports local business and we comment on the rise of veganism. The booming beauty market is far from pretty. From the use of toxic chemicals to the prevalence of animal testing, we find that the ethical issues in this sector are often hidden from sight. Many of the issues from our homes & garden are often hidden from the consumer, from toxic chemicals in our cleaning products to pesticides in our garden. We look at the greenest way to wash, clean and cook and how to recycle your old appliances. The mainstream banking & insurance industries continue to invest in shady investments such as fossil fuels and nuclear weapons. However, a growing number of ethical alternatives makes it easier than ever to switch to a sustainable bank account or pick an insurance company with an ethical policy. We look at shops or online platforms that sell a range of products, and how they tend to dominate the market by implementing a profit-first business model and by having a lacklustre approach to ethical practice. We also celebrate ethical companies offering an alternative, from online retailers to sustainable fashion brands. The tech sector is plagued by reports of tax avoidance, corporate lobbying and the use of conflict minerals. We look at the brands proving that technology can be made ethically, from Fairphone to Green ISP. Are you a lover of the outdoors? Unfortunately the companies that provide your outdoor gear & transport are often harming the environment; from car companies cheating emission tests to outdoor gear companies using toxic chemicals that damage the environment. We provide practical information for consumers on how to keep your ethics while you travel. In this guide we investigate, score and rank the ethical and environmental record of 13 rechargeable and non-rechargeable battery brands. We also look at toxic pollution, recycling old batteries and give our Best Buys and recommended buys. This is a product guide from Ethical Consumer, the UK's leading alternative consumer organisation. Since 1989 we've been researching and recording the social and environmental records of companies, and making the results available to you in a simple format. Rechargeable batteries can be recharged up to 1000 times. We expect companies that produce electrical goods to have robust conflict minerals policies so consumers can be sure they aren't sourcing materials that exacerbate conflict. Even though they can be recycled you'll be sending them for recycling more often than if you had rechargeables.

The positives and negatives of the battery market When it comes to batteries, \\u2018reduce, reuse, recycle\\u2019 is a good approach. All batteries are recyclable; buying rechargeable batteries means you can reuse them multiple times; and, especially as there are no Best Buys in this guide, it is always useful to question which battery-hungry devices are actually necessary at all. There is a multitude of different types of batteries out there, and it is currently a dynamic market, with a lot of research going into improving battery technology. For this guide, we are focusing on the most commonly available consumer batteries so will mainly be talking about We look at the human and environmental impacts of batteries at both the start and end of their life-cycle as well as exploring some of the key ways that consumers and manufacturers can lessen these impacts. Fujitsu, Panasonic, Energizer/Eveready, GP, Kodak, Berkshire Hathaway (Duracell) and Philips all lost a full mark under Anti-Social Finance for having company structures often used for tax avoidance purposes. Wilko, Multibrands (Supacell) and Varta did not lose marks for likely use of tax avoidance strategies. With the exception of Philips, every single company on the list received Ethical Consumer\\u2019s worst rating for its conflicts minerals policy, which saw them lose whole marks under both Human Rights and Habitats and Resources. Philips received Ethical Consumer\\u2019s best rating. Excessive director pay Panasonic, Energizer, GP, Kodak, Berkshire Hathaway (Duracell) and Philips all lost half a mark under AntiSocial Finance due to having directors paid annual salaries of over \\u00a31,000,000. As covered on page 42 we have just updated our Despite the reduced number of countries included on our list, five companies still lost a full mark under Human Rights for having operations in over six of these countries. These were Berkshire Hathaway, Fujitsu, Philips, Wilko and Panasonic. Energizer and Kodak both lost half a mark for having operations in two to four oppressive regimes. While they were not marked down Varta and Multibrands (Supacell) still both had operations in one oppressive regime. While they are named after individual metals, many batteries actually contain a mix of the same metals. For example, lithium-ion batteries contain nickel, and some nickel batteries contain lithium. Cobalt also tends to be present in most rechargeable batteries. The impacts of extracting these metals paint a fairly bleak picture, described below. However, none of this is a reason to completely avoid batteries, which are essential for us to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, as this is reliant on our ability to store power. There are actions we can take. To start with, we can ensure we use rechargable batteries, use them as efficiently as possible and, when they do run out, make sure we recycle them rather than sending them to landfill or leaving them squirrelled away in odd corners of the house. And we can put pressure on companies to improve their standards. Lithium batteries are, in many ways, a step forward. The increased power holding capabilities and lighter weight of lithium technology not only means that we need fewer batteries but has also been hugely important for the development of electric vehicles. However, the increasing demand for lithium is not without its negative impacts. Lithium is extracted from brine found under salt flats. Salt flats in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have some of the highest concentrations of lithium in the world. This has seen mining companies flocking to the area to profit from this now highly sought-after element. Serious concerns have been raised by the Indigenous communities living in these areas about how much they share in the benefits from the operations on their land, as well as the possible environmental impacts of extensive mining. In land where water is already scarce, the amount being used by the mining companies can reduce access for local communities as well as contaminate fresh water sources with salt or chemicals. \\u201d, Luisa Jorge, a leader in Susques, While the huge increase in demand for lithium is not primarily driven by consumer batteries, more and more of them rely on the metal. As well as this, many of the companies producing consumer batteries are also manufacturing phones, laptops or electric car batteries which certainly are driving up demand. For example, the Washington Lithium is extracted from salt flats, but are local indigenous communities in South America losing out? Post\\u2019s expos\\u00e9 links Panasonic to one of the Corporations need to ensure that important solutions to the climate crisis are not implemented through further destruction and exploitation: \\u201c Nickel is a vital component of lithiumion as well as NiMH batteries. Unfortunately, the extraction of nickel has been linked with high levels of environmental destruction and toxic pollution. In 2016, New Internationalist reported on the on local communities in Colombia, with drastic increases in birth defects, miscarriages and cancer, as well as numerous other illnesses. Dayro Romero, governor of the Indigenous community of Pueblo Flecha told the publication: \\u201c Extreme pollution could be prevented if mining companies were under more scrutiny to adhere to standards of best practice. Companies could insist on certification from independent organisations such as the (IRMA) to ensure that mining becomes more environmentally and socially responsible. Cobalt is an important component of both lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries and A significant amount of cobalt is sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Publicly traded companies in the US are required to report on the tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold they source from the DRC, but it has been up to campaign groups to put pressure on companies to report on cobalt. The Responsible Sourcing Network works to create multi-stakeholder initiatives to address human rights abuses in problematic supply chains. It publishes a yearly report analysing corporate compliance under Special Disclosure of US conflict mineral legislation. The organisation It does not carry the same risk of supporting armed conflict, as cobalt mines are generally located in the south of the country, but child slavery and poor working conditions have been shown to be widespread. Graphite is used as a cathode (the positive end) in many batteries, including alkaline and lithium ones. Graphite mines and refiners are causing serious pollution in many Chinese towns and villages in Heilongjiang province. . Villagers living in the area told the journalists about \\u201c While there is less coverage of these, the extraction of other metals frequently found in batteries such as manganese, zinc and potassium is not without issues either, as environmental destruction, pollution and exploitation seem to go hand in hand with the mining industry. All types of batteries can be recycled with the metals used being completely recoverable, with no limits on the number of times they can be recycled. Recycling batteries also prevents their disposal from polluting the environment. When batteries are just left to decay photochemical reactions can release greenhouse gases, and the harmful heavy metals can be absorbed into soil or find their way into water supplies, lakes and rivers. Incorrectly disposed batteries can also pose a fire hazard. Forty firefighters were at the beginning of the year. The fire was thought to have started when a spark from a lithium-ion battery ignited surrounding rubbish. In the UK, any company selling more than 32kg of portable batteries a year must provide a take-back scheme, and they , except those from motor vehicles or industrial equipment. The collection points at supermarkets thus do accept all kinds, not just AA. The UK has battery recycling targets set by the EU. While it failed to meet these in previous years, the target was met in 2018. The UK collected 17,811 tonnes of used batteries against a target of 17,540. , but it still represents just 45% of all the batteries placed into the market in the previous three years. Concerns have also been raised that lead-acid batteries are being included in these figures when It is interesting that while all the battery brands in this guide are recyclable, there do not appear to be any batteries out there that are advertised as being made from recycled materials.

Charging forward \\u2013 what\\u2019s next for batteries? Professor John Goodenough invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1980s. Fortunately, the scientific community is not applying the inventors surname to the battery itself. Battery technology is the focus of intense research, due to the urgent need to transition to renewable energy and the rising demand for portable electronics. There are possibilities for the next generation of batteries to be based on more abundant elements such as sodium, found in all kinds of salt, or aluminium. This could, in theory, mean that the elements in batteries can be extracted in locations which would cause the least damage, with vicinity to local communities, shipping miles and the local environment all taken into account. Other technologies such as metal-air batteries, solid-state batteries and the use of silicon are all vying to try and increase capacity, and also safety, while reducing production costs. The fact that rising demands for batteries are, in part, fuelled by a desire to reduce environmental impact, could mean that ethical considerations are given more scrutiny in the battery industry than in others. This year, Amnesty International publicly challenged electric car manufacturers to create a truly ethical battery within five years. Kumi Naidoo, With demand for batteries soaring, now is the time for a drastic overhaul of our energy sources that prioritises protection of human rights and the environment. With a climate crisis looming, consumers have the right to demand that products marketed as the ethical choice really stand up to scrutiny. We need to change course now, or those least responsible for climate change \\u2013 indigenous communities and children \\u2013 will pay the price for the shift away from fossil fuels. However, we may not be buying separate batteries for that much longer, as more and more products are switching to inbuilt rechargeable batteries. This does mean that people are forced to use rechargeables, but all batteries are perishable, and it can make the whole product die with the battery. The following table provides a quick run-down on how not to run-down different types of batteries as well as some general information about how long you can expect them to last. It is better to fast charge if possible. Stop charging if battery becomes warm. Always use the charger designed for your battery. A partial discharge is actually also better than a full discharge ( like old NiCad batteries which used to lose capacity if not used). Turn off devices when charging the battery. Always use the charger designed for your battery. Remove from the device and store below 25\\u00b0C (do not freeze). Can be stored with any charge level but should be fully recharged once a year if storing long term. Remove from the device and store below 25\\u00b0C (do not freeze) with a charge of around 40-50%.

       "       \"content\": \"The battery industry currently uses 42 percent of global cobalt production, a critical metal for Lithium-ion cells. The remaining 58 percent is used in diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments\\u2026) that rely exclusively on the material. Approximately 97 percent of the world\\u2019s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper (mostly out of Africa). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Lundin agreed to sell to Chinese players their respective stakes in the Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the largest known cobalt sources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tesla has stated that the cobalt it needs will be sourced exclusively in North America, but the math doesn\\u2019t seem to add up. Is Tesla doomed? Not necessarily\\u2026 The Tenke Fungurume mine is one of the world\\u2019s largest known cobalt resources. The concessions are located in the Katanga province in the southeast region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: ) holds a 56 percent interest, Lundin Mining (OTCPK: ) holds an indirect 24 percent equity interest and G\\u00e9camines, the Congolese state mining company, holds a 20 percent carried interest. for US$2.65 billion, the largest investment ever in the country. Lundin Mining was left with three options: allow the China Moly deal to proceed, supplant the offer by exercising a right to first offer or sell its own stake to China Moly (or a third party, for that matter). In November, and after several extensions, Lundin Mining finally it was selling its 24 percent stake to an affiliate of Chinese private-equity firm BHR Partners for US$1.14 billion. Freeport\\u2019s sale to China Moly was expected to be completed before year\\u2019s end, whilst Lundin plans to close its sale in early 2017. China Moly also acquired this year from Freeport a 100 percent interest in the Kisanfu exploration project located in the DRC and a 56 percent controlling interest in the Kokkola refinery in Finland (about 10 percent of the world\\u2019s refined cobalt last year). Needless to say that all that cobalt from the refinery is expected to be shipped to China, South Korea and Japan from now on. The implications are clear. China is now leveling its game in upstream cobalt and is already a major owner of downstream assets in the DRC, embodied by Huayou Cobalt (CH: ) and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt (CH: ). It will keep on securing cobalt mines and downstream assets for its own needs. In November, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, head of the state-controlled G\\u00e9camines, to the Financial Times his discontent of partnerships with western companies and, in particular, on the Freeport-McMoRan deal. Left with minority investments in most joint ventures (JV), Mr. Yuma believes that existing deals failed to deliver on dividends. The partnership with China Nonferrous Metal Mining. where G\\u00e9camines has a 49 percent stake, is the model he wants to generalize. One more headache for western operators. , we are already witnessing an increased scarcity of cobalt supply. Approximately 97 percent of the world\\u2019s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. But the price of the two other base metals have been plunging, to say the least, and this year reached six-year lows, making many deposits uneconomic. New primary cobalt mines may come online should cobalt prices soar; however, exploration, licensing and development take time and require billions of dollars of investments. In addition, 60 percent of the world\\u2019s cobalt reserves and resources originate in the DRC, which is riddled with child labor and exploitation. On the demand front, and according to the (CDI), 58 percent of global cobalt production is already used in many diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments\\u2026) that rely exclusively on the material. Cobalt represents a negligible part of the costs for these companies and thus they can afford to pay regardless of the price. But that is a dangerous game for battery makers. Material costs account for about 60 percent of LIB total cost and battery makers cannot take away cobalt from companies for whom the metal is an absolute requirement. Think GE and its jet engines. So where does that leave us with Tesla? Elon Musk ambitiously aims at producing electric vehicles a year by 2018, and Tesla has repeatedly that the cobalt will be sourced exclusively in North America. Whether this is a realistic assumption is a different story. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) that cobalt production in 2015 was 124,000 metric tons. Canada and the U.S. together produce roughly 4 percent of the world\\u2019s supply, nowhere near Tesla\\u2019s needs for just one of its models. Indeed, estimations from show that half a million units of Tesla\\u2019s Model 3 would be equivalent to 7,800 tons of new cobalt demand, or roughly 6 percent of the annual cobalt production worldwide. The math does not seem to add up. Tesla reportedly has difficulties securing off-take agreements from traditional cathode material suppliers and is reaching down to junior miners. Precisely regarding the juniors\\u2019 landscape, eCobalt Solutions Inc. (formerly Formation Metals) (TSX: ) is a Canadian mineral exploration and mine development company primarily owning the , a high-grade and primary cobalt deposit in the U.S.. The highly anticipated project is by far the most advanced one in the region and should go online in a year\\u2019s time. Two more years will be needed to run at full capacity. Production is estimated to reach roughly 1,500 tons annually over the course of a 12.5-year lifetime, i.e. about 1 percent of the global market. Compare this to Tesla\\u2019s needs for the Model 3 and the new supply of cobalt in North America looks muted at best. Basic economics would tell us that whenever there is a soaring demand and a market supply moving into deficit, shortages and consequently an impact on prices are inevitable. Tesla looks doomed\\u2026 ceteris paribus. So, is it really? Good news for Tesla bulls: There are several reasons why this may not be the case. nickel-cobalt-aluminium-based (NCA) battery cells sourced from Panasonic. Again, we don\\u2019t know the exact composition of the Panasonic/Tesla batteries, but typically cobalt represents about 0.22 kg/kWh in NCA batteries believes from InvestorIntel. This compares to 0.36 kg/kWh for nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, which are adopted by most peers (and in which the three components are usually evenly split). Tesla would withstand more pressure versus its peers in the event of soaring prices. The Chinese BYD, a major player in the EV space, has lower energy density Lithium-Iron-Phosphate LFP chemistry. Reconfiguring manufacturing capabilities and use instead as LFP or Lithium-manganese-oxide (LMO) that don\\u2019t need cobalt is always an option. However, this might severely hamper competitiveness and quality. \\u201cCeteris paribus\\u201d is key here. A complete shift away from high-energy batteries looks hypothetical at this stage: NMC, NCA and LCO batteries provide the highest energy density as reported by , and all require cobalt. However, there has been recently efforts to produce other types of battery chemistries that do not require cobalt as stated by the . Tesla has also been trying to remove cobalt from the equation and add nickel instead, We may well see a quick turnaround from cobalt-intensive batteries toward a validated and optimized new high-energy battery technology should it go online. And the high costs triggered by a shift away from traditional batteries might prove beneficial when opposed with the prospects a cobalt cliff. So far attempts for substituting cobalt resulted in a loss in product performance. But nothing is set in stone. Let\\u2019s assume for a second that the substitution project remains in draft and that cobalt remains indispensable. Around Ninety-five percent of the world\\u2019s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. As by John Petersen, \\u201cEvery year, the world\\u2019s nickel miners sell $14.58 billion of nickel and $1.05 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 6.7% of their total revenue. It\\u2019s even worse with copper miners who sell $68.4 billion of copper and $0.92 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 1.3% of their total revenue.\\u201d Certainly frightening numbers. Many mines have become a casualty of the low prices and many are being taken offline or \\u201cplaced on maintenance\\u201d for an extended period of time until market prices justify further investments. However, if it is well-established that the dependence on a primary product is a key supply risk, the opposite is also true. There will be cobalt if there is enough demand for the primary metals. It is unclear what the mix of Panasonic/Tesla\\u2019s batteries is, but traditionally an NCA cathode is of roughly 80 percent nickel and 15 percent cobalt. Increased demand for nickel may spur nickel production and, as a consequence, cobalt product. This may overall add some counterweight in the balance. In addition, identified cobalt resources are much larger than existing reserves. to the CDI, \\u201cthere seems to be enough known land sources of cobalt to last for at least 100 years and for many, many more years if speculative and hypothetical resources for deep sea, ocean floor resources are taken into account (about 120 million tonnes according to the USGS).\\u201d The CDI thus remains confident that \\u201ccobalt is not running out, but its availability will depend upon many factors such as accessibility, price, demand, technological development and global economic growth.\\u201d Obviously mining cobalt cheaply in deep water is nothing more than a bad science fiction movie, but should become economically viable (disruptive technologies might start showing their teeth, as we have witnessed in deep water drilling and more recently with fracking). Cobalt (as opposed to oil, for instance) is fully . Roughly 15 percent of U.S. cobalt consumption is from recycled scrap today. For many applications, the metal is used but not consumed and so can be recycled. Needless to say that recycling can help reduce the need to hunt for new sources of cobalt. In no circumstances is this a magic solution whereby 100 percent can be recycled indefinitely. Existing processes are energy-consuming and can definitely be improved. But that is also an idea to weigh in the balance. That\\u2019s a lot of \\u201cifs,\\u201d I grant you that. Tesla is entering an age of supply chain transparency, as Simon Moores from Benchmark Intelligence states, and it wouldn\\u2019t hurt to see more communication from Tesla on that front. However, there are many factors that could be part of a complex cobalt equation. I wouldn\\u2019t go as far as surrender already and turn into a structural Tesla bear. \",\n",

       "       \"content\": \"iPhones & Other Electronics Could Have A Child Labor Problem, A Terrifying New Report Says For many, your iPhone is your personal assistant, source of entertainment, and connection to loved ones \\u2014 but do you know what goes into the piece of technology you stare at for hours a day? A CBS News investigation recently found that children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are mining a chemical element that's used to make much of the world's cellphone, laptop, and electric car batteries. The report raises the question: More than half of the world's cobalt, the chemical element used to make batteries, comes from the Congo. And tens of thousands of Congolese kids as young as 4 years old help mine that cobalt, according to CBS News. \\\"The work is hard enough for an adult man, but it is unthinkable for a child,\\\" the report says. A 2016 Amnesty International report found that was used in products from numerous tech companies, including Apple. mined by hand in the DRC following continued reports that children were working the mines there. Later in 2017, Amnesty International declared that Apple had taken \\\"adequate\\\" actions to address the child labor allegations within the cobalt supply chain. \\\" for responsible cobalt sourcing \\u2014 but the bar is low,\\\" read an Amnesty report published in November. The majority of the cobalt CBS News tracked is reportedly sold to the Chinese company Congo Dongfang Mining, owned by the global cobalt supplier Huayou. Huayou told CBS News it stopped buying from the last year. Apple also stopped buying cobalt from Huayou, telling CBS News in a statement, \\\" until independent validators can assure us it's being mined responsibly.\\\" Apple did not immediately respond to Bustle's request for comment. A 2017 Apple supplier responsibility report says 100 percent of its cobalt partners now participate in \\\"to ensure their own business practices are conducted responsibly.\\\" But Amnesty International's November report says not publicizing assessments of each supplier \\\"makes it impossible to say whether they are fulfilling their human rights responsibilities.\\\" The CBS News report highlights how difficult it can be to trace where \\u2014 and by whom \\u2014 cobalt was mined in the current global supply chain. \\\"But in this murky process of sourcing cobalt,\\\" the report says, \\\"one thing is clear; children are still here, carrying the weight of our high-tech world on their shoulders.\\\" Four-year-olds reportedly pick cobalt out of piles as 10-year-olds carry heavy bags of the chemical element. \\\"Even those too young to work \\u2014 dust-covered infants clinging to their mothers and playing on the dirty ground \\u2014 spend much of the day breathing in toxic fumes,\\\" according to the report. Because cobalt is used to make batteries for so many electronics, including electric vehicles growing in popularity, consumers all over the world could be using technology brought to life using child labor in the Congo. \\\"Companies have an individual responsibility to identify, prevent, address and account for human rights abuses in their cobalt supply chains,\\\" Amnesty's November report reads. \\\"Where a company has contributed to, or benefited from, child labour or adults working in hazardous conditions, it has a responsibility to remediate the harm suffered.\\\" The human rights organization urges tech giants to work with local governments and other companies to combat the problem and help the affected children transition from working in cobalt mines to attending school. The child labor problem may be complex, but human rights organizations believe companies should be doing more to stop it. \",\n",

The mineral they\\u2019re pulling out of the ground is an essential component in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which power mobile phones and laptops as well as electric vehicles and home batteries. The hunt for cobalt has triggered a modern-day gold rush in Kolwezi, the capital of Lualaba Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Cobalt has quadrupled in price in the last two years, driven in part by the global electric vehicle boom. Two-thirds of the world\\u2019s cobalt comes from Congo, which has been mired in conflict for decades, and about a fifth of that is mined by hand. But with children often working alongside adults in artisanal mines it poses an ethical dilemma for multinationals. Apple stopped sourcing from artisanal mines last year in light of these concerns, opting to pay more for cobalt from regulated industrial mines, which have more visibility over their supply chain. They\\u2019re now reportedly in talks to buy cobalt directly from Congo miners \\u2014 Apple wouldn\\u2019t comment on these reports to CNN. All of this comes as Congo is rushing to clean up its image. The Lualaba provincial government has partnered with one of the largest suppliers of artisanal cobalt \\u2014 China\\u2019s Congo Dongfang International Mining (CDM) \\u2014 to create the country\\u2019s first model cobalt mining cooperative. Entrance and access to the mine, opened three months ago in Kasulo (a district of Kolwezi), is controlled by security guards and the minerals extracted there are certified by the government \\u2014 now seven years into a five-year term. Governor of Lualaba Province Richard Muyej told CNN that, through reforms like this, the government hopes to eliminate child labor from the supply chain. The facility is supposed to set a new standard for ethical mining, but in a country where natural resources have long been entwined with war and corruption, the reality is much murkier. CDM was named in as buying cobalt mined by children. CNN traveled to Lualaba Province to track the cobalt supply chain, from small-scale mines to the world\\u2019s biggest electronics and electric vehicle brands. Before we even set out, the governor warned us to expect to see some children in the mines, a situation he claimed had improved. This is what Christian and many others are mining for \\u2014 dark stones with a slightly blue pigment. After the cobalt is mined, it has to be washed, sorted, and crushed. It\\u2019s long, back-breaking work. And it\\u2019s hazardous \\u2014 chronic exposure to cobalt particles can cause respiratory disease and skin issues. At Lake Malo, a woman who only gave her surname Tembu, has been toiling away in knee-high water for almost 12 hours to grind 22 pounds of cobalt ore down to a gravel-like consistency, worth about $7. Amnesty International researchers visited the same lake in 2015, and reported seeing about 100 people \\u2014 many of them children \\u2014 washing and sorting ore containing cobalt and copper. Before we arrived, local mining officials cleared a group of young children from the lake. We could see them clambering up a hillside, bags of cobalt in hand. We went to another nearby washing place \\u2014 Musonoie River \\u2014 to see whether officials would block us from observing child labor there too. We arrived in time to see a handful of remaining boys sorting through stones. One child was struck by an official for being captured on camera, clutching a heavy sack of cobalt. From the banks of the river, those same sacks of cobalt are loaded into vehicles, onto bicycles, or carried over shoulders to market to be sold. At Kapata Market, in the outskirts of Kolwezi, the cobalt is bought by brokers at trading houses \\u2014 many of them Chinese-owned. The going rates for cobalt and copper are posted on handwritten posters. The traders test each haul with an XRF analyzer, a radar gun-like device that measures mineral content, before buying. None of them ask who mined the cobalt, which they will sell to bigger companies to refine and export. Multiple whistleblowers told CNN that CDM regularly purchases cobalt from Kapata Market, despite being banned by the government from doing so. But CDM says it stopped buying from public markets in 2017 in an effort to eliminate child-mined cobalt from its supplies. CDM told CNN it would investigate the claims and plans to release a supply chain audit in the coming weeks. While at the market, government mining officials once more tried to stop us from filming. The same mining ministry officials tasked with enforcing an ethical supply chain, who had given CNN permission to film, attempted to block our investigation at every step. The Lualaba governor said that this was a misunderstanding. Governor Muyej says companies using cobalt from Congo need to work more closely with the government. \\u201cWe must work together to make the issue of traceability transparent and to make the sites safe and regularized,\\u201d Muyej said. He added that companies could do much more for the local community by investing in education.

       "       \"content\": \"Electric cars have been around since before the Civil War Electric cars have existed since at least 1834, long before gasoline cars were invented. Since the beginning, they have faced the same hurdles they do today: limited driving range and a lack of charging infrastructure. But things are changing fast. Thomas Davenport of Vermont builds the first useful electric motor. Other inventors, including Michael Faraday, have previously built small devices that move using electricity, but Davenport\\u2019s are the first with the power to do actual work. He reportedly uses one of his new motors to power a small carriage. French physicist Gaston Plant\\u00e9 invents the lead-acid battery. Other scientists, including Plant\\u00e9 himself, will improve on the invention in the decades to come. Famed English inventor Thomas Parker -- called the \\u201cThe Edison of Europe\\u201d -- creates the first commercially viable electric car. Unlike many of Parker\\u2019s other inventions, such as electric trams, underground lighting and a smokeless fuel called \\u201cCoalite,\\u201d the car attracts little interest. , generally credited as being the first internal combustion-powered automobile and the precursor of all gasoline-powered cars today. Electric cars have already been around for 50 years. Fleets of electric taxi cabs are introduced in both Paris and New York. Dr. Ferdinand Porsche builds his first car, the Egger-Lohner Model C.2 Phaeton, which is powered by electricity. The first speeding ticket in America is given to the driver of one of New York\\u2019s electric cabs. He\\u2019s pulled over by a bike riding police officer while driving 12 miles an hour in an 8 mile per hour zone. Belgian race driver Camille Jenatzy becomes the first person to drive over 100 kilometers an hour, or 62 miles per hour, in a specially built electric car called \\\"La Jamais Contente,\\u201d or \\u201cThe Never Satisfied.\\u201d Electric cars rise to prominence as more viable alternatives to steam cars, which can take 45 minutes to start in the morning, and to gasoline cars, which have to be cranked to start and that required complicated gear shifting. As a result, electric cars are advertised as especially suitable for women given their lighter physical demands. By the turn of the century, more than a third of all cars on American roads are electric. The electric car\\u2019s prominence will be short-lived, however, as technological advancements soon give gasoline power an overwhelming lead. Ford Motor Co. introduces the Model T. Thanks to repeated improvements in its production, this gasoline-powered car will become ever cheaper to buy and nearly ubiquitous on American roads. (Still, Henry Ford\\u2019s wife, Clara, drives an electric car which she prefers to her husband\\u2019s noisy creations.) General Motors introduces the electric starter on the Cadillac Touring Edition, eliminating the need to crank the engine. This invention removes one of the most objectionable aspects of driving a gasoline-powered car. Over the following decades, electric cars virtually disappear from the roads as gasoline and diesel power take over. Electric cars will continue to be hampered by their limited driving range, long charging times and bulky batteries. One answer to the electric cars\\u2019 shortcomings is an onboard nuclear reactor. Ford\\u2019s Nucleon concept car, really just a model, is envisioned as having a reactor core that can power the car for 5,000 miles. After that, spent fuel rods will be swapped out at a convenient service station. The Nucleon was designed based on the assumption that, someday, nuclear reactors could be made safe enough for use in cars, a popular idea at the time. During the late 1950s and throughout the \\u201860s, various startup automakers attempt to popularize electric cars, but none really gain traction. The Nu-Klea Starlite was offered for a few years by Kish Industries, a company based just outside Lansing, Michigan. Major automakers haven\\u2019t totally given up on the potential of electric cars. General Motors experiments with the Electrovair, a Chevrolet Corvair converted to run on batteries. Years later, GM also creates the Electrovette, an electric Chevrolet Chevette. American Motors Corporation, which was later absorbed by Chrysler, unveils the Amitron, a prototype electric car. The company says it plans to offer the Amitron for sale in just a few years. That never happens. The Sebring-Vanguard company of Sebring, Florida, introduces the CitiCar, which becomes one of the most popular electric cars in many years. More than 4,400 are ultimately sold. Top speed for the CitiCar is 38 miles an hour. For better or worse, cars like this will shape the public\\u2019s image of electric cars as essentially road-going golf carts for a long time. The cobalt-oxide cathode, the heart of the lithium-ion battery, is invented by John Goodenough and his colleagues at Oxford University. In the decades to come, batteries made possible by this invention will power all sorts of consumer electronics, as well as electric cars that can travel hundreds of miles on a charge. California passes the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate, which requires automakers operating in California to sell a certain percentage of Zero Emission Vehicles each year.

       "       \"content\": \"New rechargeable batteries that use iron instead of cobalt could be a game changer for electric cars It would be a dull month if a new rechargeable battery project didn\\u2019t make headlines amid all the excitement surrounding electric cars. This month\\u2019s indisputable The potential implications of this invention are huge: Cobalt is enjoying a very strong rally as demand is estimated to skyrocket with the influx of electric cars in the world\\u2019s biggest markets, notably China and the United States. So is lithium, but the iron battery is unlikely to have an impact on lithium demand. Also, theoretically, the iron battery could put some battery makers out of business. The idea of using iron in batteries isn\\u2019t new, but so far, attempts to substitute the cheap metal for costlier cobalt and other metals have ended in disaster. Christopher Wolverton, professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern University, had two problems to solve to make his battery work. First, replace cobalt with iron. Second, trick oxygen into taking part in the reaction that moves the lithium ions from the anode to the cathode and back again as the battery is charged and discharged. The second challenge was the bigger one. The widespread opinion in science circles is that using oxygen in the reaction taking place in a rechargeable battery makes the concoction inside unstable and oxygen escapes, making the reaction irreversible and the battery non-rechargeable. That\\u2019s why Wolverton and his team first made the battery on a computer to see if it would work. Surprisingly for all, it did\\u2014and better than the most popular lithium-ion batteries. The iron battery uses four lithium ions instead of just one like current batteries do. For now, it can only utilize one of these, but there\\u2019s potential for making use of all four, considerably increasing the battery\\u2019s efficiency. That\\u2019s really exciting, but the official news release is shy on the experimental aspect of the team\\u2019s work. There\\u2019s mention that there was an author in charge of the experimental work, but all the details about the composition of the battery and the reaction are about the computations the team made. These computations were used to make the physical battery, but the experimental stage of the project is likely at an early stage. Should further experiments confirm the initial results, this battery has the potential to transform many markets\\u2014all that deal in rechargeable devices\\u2014from cars to smartphones and wearables. Iron is among the cheapest metals in the world, with a metric ton currently trading for less than $77. To compare, the three-month futures on cobalt on the London Metal Exchange is $75,000 per metric ton. Even that would be enough to make the new battery a hit if its viability is confirmed. The greater durability would also be a welcome bonus. With a battery like that, the EV revolution could truly take off.

       "       \"content\": \"Breakthrough set to lower cobalt use in car batteries Sahin Kenan\\u2019s invention GEMX can be used in a number of types of power packs and it has been granted patents in the US, the EU, China and Japan The scientist-turned-entrepreneur behind a battery technology adopted by chemical giants BASF SE and Johnson Matthey PLC is back with another invention that he says would boost electric vehicle performance for years to come. Sahin Kenan, 77, said his innovation reduces the need for cobalt, a key battery material, to only the most critical areas to lower costs. The blueish-gray element is mined mostly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) and prices have spiked amid fears of shortages for battery-powered cars. Kenan\\u2019s invention, called GEMX, can be used in a number of types of nickel-based power packs and has been granted patents in the US, the EU, China and Japan \\u2014 the major battery manufacturing markets. In Berlin this week for an annual car industry conference, he said he is in talks with large manufacturers and one has already agreed to buy a license. \\u201cWe\\u2019re hoping we will get this into the hands of the major producers,\\u201d Kenan said in a telephone interview. The technique could lower cobalt content to as little as 4 percent of battery cathodes from about 20 percent needed in some now, he said. Lowering the amount of cobalt in batteries would help reduce reliance on war-torn DR Congo, where child labor and unsafe working practices are a headache for automakers such as BMW AG and Volkswagen AG, whose supply chains are under scrutiny. Kenan\\u2019s technique consists of inserting the element into specific spaces within the chemical structure of cathodes so less is needed. His story is an unlikely tale of success. After traveling to the US from Turkey at age 16 on an exchange program, he went on to build a customer-service software company that he sold to Lucent Technologies Inc for US$1.5 billion. He then pumped almost US$100 million of his own fortune into developing cathodes, the mission-critical chemical compounds that determine how far a car battery can run between charges. During his quest, Kenan was up against some of the world\\u2019s biggest chemical companies as they raced to corner the nascent market for battery materials, but rather than go head-on, Kenan opted to work with them. BASF was keen to catch up with cathode market leader Umicore SA and in April 2016 turned to Kenan\\u2019s CAMX Power company and its lithium nickel-oxide formula. Two months later, Johnson Matthey followed suit. The London-based company had been in talks to acquire Kenan\\u2019s company until BASF pounced on a license, forcing it to settle for a similar arrangement, according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified. Kenan declined to discuss relationships with the two companies, whose representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Both companies took Kenan\\u2019s CAMX technology and developed it further. Johnson Matthey now plans to spend as much as \\uffe1200 million (US$261.16 million) on ramping up production of cathodes based on the invention. BASF has announced its own plan to invest as much as 400 million euros (US$456.25 million) on making cathodes, although it has not yet specified which chemistry it plans to use.

       "       \"content\": \"Electric cars have been around since before the Civil War Electric cars have existed since at least 1834, long before gasoline cars were invented. Since the beginning, they have faced the same hurdles they do today: limited driving range and a lack of charging infrastructure. But things are changing fast. Thomas Davenport of Vermont builds the first useful electric motor. Other inventors, including Michael Faraday, have previously built small devices that move using electricity, but Davenport\\u2019s are the first with the power to do actual work. He reportedly uses one of his new motors to power a small carriage. French physicist Gaston Plant\\u00e9 invents the lead-acid battery. Other scientists, including Plant\\u00e9 himself, will improve on the invention in the decades to come. Famed English inventor Thomas Parker -- called the \\u201cThe Edison of Europe\\u201d -- creates the first commercially viable electric car. Unlike many of Parker\\u2019s other inventions, such as electric trams, underground lighting and a smokeless fuel called \\u201cCoalite,\\u201d the car attracts little interest. , generally credited as being the first internal combustion-powered automobile and the precursor of all gasoline-powered cars today. Electric cars have already been around for 50 years. Fleets of electric taxi cabs are introduced in both Paris and New York. Dr. Ferdinand Porsche builds his first car, the Egger-Lohner Model C.2 Phaeton, which is powered by electricity. The first speeding ticket in America is given to the driver of one of New York\\u2019s electric cabs. He\\u2019s pulled over by a bike riding police officer while driving 12 miles an hour in an 8 mile per hour zone. Belgian race driver Camille Jenatzy becomes the first person to drive over 100 kilometers an hour, or 62 miles per hour, in a specially built electric car called \\\"La Jamais Contente,\\u201d or \\u201cThe Never Satisfied.\\u201d Electric cars rise to prominence as more viable alternatives to steam cars, which can take 45 minutes to start in the morning, and to gasoline cars, which have to be cranked to start and that required complicated gear shifting. As a result, electric cars are advertised as especially suitable for women given their lighter physical demands. By the turn of the century, more than a third of all cars on American roads are electric. The electric car\\u2019s prominence will be short-lived, however, as technological advancements soon give gasoline power an overwhelming lead. Ford Motor Co. introduces the Model T. Thanks to repeated improvements in its production, this gasoline-powered car will become ever cheaper to buy and nearly ubiquitous on American roads. (Still, Henry Ford\\u2019s wife, Clara, drives an electric car which she prefers to her husband\\u2019s noisy creations.) General Motors introduces the electric starter on the Cadillac Touring Edition, eliminating the need to crank the engine. This invention removes one of the most objectionable aspects of driving a gasoline-powered car. Over the following decades, electric cars virtually disappear from the roads as gasoline and diesel power take over. Electric cars will continue to be hampered by their limited driving range, long charging times and bulky batteries. One answer to the electric cars\\u2019 shortcomings is an onboard nuclear reactor. Ford\\u2019s Nucleon concept car, really just a model, is envisioned as having a reactor core that can power the car for 5,000 miles. After that, spent fuel rods will be swapped out at a convenient service station. The Nucleon was designed based on the assumption that, someday, nuclear reactors could be made safe enough for use in cars, a popular idea at the time. During the late 1950s and throughout the \\u201860s, various startup automakers attempt to popularize electric cars, but none really gain traction. The Nu-Klea Starlite was offered for a few years by Kish Industries, a company based just outside Lansing, Michigan. Major automakers haven\\u2019t totally given up on the potential of electric cars. General Motors experiments with the Electrovair, a Chevrolet Corvair converted to run on batteries. Years later, GM also creates the Electrovette, an electric Chevrolet Chevette. American Motors Corporation, which was later absorbed by Chrysler, unveils the Amitron, a prototype electric car. The company says it plans to offer the Amitron for sale in just a few years. That never happens. The Sebring-Vanguard company of Sebring, Florida, introduces the CitiCar, which becomes one of the most popular electric cars in many years. More than 4,400 are ultimately sold. Top speed for the CitiCar is 38 miles an hour. For better or worse, cars like this will shape the public\\u2019s image of electric cars as essentially road-going golf carts for a long time. The cobalt-oxide cathode, the heart of the lithium-ion battery, is invented by John Goodenough and his colleagues at Oxford University. In the decades to come, batteries made possible by this invention will power all sorts of consumer electronics, as well as electric cars that can travel hundreds of miles on a charge. California passes the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate, which requires automakers operating in California to sell a certain percentage of Zero Emission Vehicles each year. As a practical matter, that mostly means electric cars. Automakers work to comply while some also sue to stop, or at least weaken, the requirement. A dozen other states later adopt the ZEV Mandate. Eventually, it is changed to allow automakers to buy ZEV credits as an alternative to selling the actual cars. General Motors unveils the Impact concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show. In a few years, this concept will be developed into the EV1. General Motors puts the EV1 into production. The cars are available for lease, but not for sale. Largely to comply with California\\u2019s requirements, various automakers release electric cars that are often heavily modified versions of gasoline cars.

       "       \"content\": \"Elon Musk wants cobalt out of his batteries \\u2014 here\\u2019s why that\\u2019s a challenge Everyone wants to cut out cobalt, but doing so creates performance and safety problems , the batteries powering them need to keep up. Last week, Elon Musk that batteries for the Tesla Model 3 use less than 3 percent of an expensive chemical called cobalt, and the next generation battery \\u201cwill use none\\u201d of the material that some have called the \\u201c .\\u201d How soon can that claim come true? . It\\u2019s also the most expensive material in the battery and are rushing to create a cobalt-free battery. Musk\\u2019s \\u201cnext-gen\\u201d claim is a vague phrase that doesn\\u2019t set out a definite timeline, so it\\u2019s impossible to know when he\\u2019ll deliver \\u2014 but don\\u2019t expect it to be in the next couple of years. , an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence who focuses on the cobalt market and cathodes, about why it\\u2019s so challenging to create a cobalt-free battery. When we\\u2019re talking about mined cobalt, the raw material supply largely comes from the [Democratic Republic of] Congo. Last year, 66 percent of the world\\u2019s cobalt came from the Congo. Congo really has a big stranglehold. It\\u2019s not necessarily as rare as a mineral, though it\\u2019s rarer than lithium or graphite or some others. It\\u2019s typically produced as a product, meaning it comes out as another material from nickel or copper mining. So, people are concerned because the supply of cobalt is ultimately at the mercy of the larger copper and nickel markets. If markets are suffering from low prices, and so demand, it becomes harder to invest in cobalt production. Tesla uses a formulation called NCA (nickel, cobalt, aluminum) that is already very low-cobalt. Over the last six years, Tesla and Panasonic [which supplies batteries to Tesla] have reduced cobalt dependency by about 60 percent already. That\\u2019s already very low. We think it\\u2019s going to be difficult for them to go much lower because you run into engineering problems. Cobalt is the safe element in the cathode. As you reduce it, you reduce the life cycle of the cell. The current market standard for electric vehicles is an eight-year warranty to retain 80 percent of the original capacity of the battery. You need to be sure your battery can do that, otherwise, you\\u2019ll have to replace it under warranty, which is way more expensive than the theoretical savings you gain from less cobalt. And there\\u2019s a safety issue as well. As you decrease the amount of cobalt, you increase the amount of nickel. The cells can overheat and it can no longer effectively cool itself, which can lead to combustion. That\\u2019s a relatively low risk but it\\u2019s not a risk that can be taken and you need special technology to avoid that. Plus, the low-cobalt formulations need to produce in special dry environments, and so there\\u2019s a cost to making them, too. I think it\\u2019s very challenging from an engineering standpoint to solve these problems, so I think the current NCA technology is going to be the dominant technology for the next 10 years. The cobalt-free battery is something Panasonic is working on, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s around the corner. Panasonic is probably ordering more cobalt simply because they need to make more batteries. Tesla is ramping up production and they have a deal with Toyota. That\\u2019s the multibillion-dollar question. Electric vehicles are creating a true demand for cobalt now and that\\u2019s going to be around for a long time. Demand for cobalt used to be mostly for superalloys used in jet engines and hardware. Now, over 50 percent of demand is coming from the battery sector, which is going to completely change the industry. At the same time, there are a number of new projects to mine cobalt in DRC. I think we\\u2019ll have stable prices until about 2022, when demand is going to exceed what new supplies can come, and then prices are likely to increase. There are things like advanced lithium-ion batteries, which use little cobalt and could be here in a couple of years. But we\\u2019re really getting toward the physiochemical limit of what those materials can do. To me, the next generation is something like solid-state batteries with the solid anode, but they\\u2019re a long way off. Other things, like sodium-ion batteries, are still on the lab scale and you need to get from lab to research to pilot testing, to cathode testing to battery testing. We\\u2019re looking at least 10 more years for that. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future. \",\n",

       "       \"content\": \"Electric car boom relies on DR Congo avoiding renewed chaos Each electric vehicle requires about 15kg of cobalt to manufacture the batteries that power it. However, most of the world\\u2019s supply of the metal comes from the DR Congo, where political tensions are escalating again The cars of the future will depend increasingly upon supplies of a metal from a country in the African tropics where there has never been a peaceful transition of power and child labor is still used in parts of the mining industry. Most major automakers are pledging to build millions of electric vehicles as the world\\u2019s governments crack down on climate-damaging emissions from traditional-fuel engines. As a result, demand is surging for lithium-ion batteries and the materials needed to make them \\u2014 including cobalt, a relatively rare substance found mostly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The country formerly known as Zaire \\u2014 which hosted boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman for their 1974 heavyweight title bout dubbed the \\u201cRumble in the Jungle\\u201d \\u2014 supplies 63 percent of the world\\u2019s cobalt. The DR Congo\\u2019s market share may jump to 73 percent by 2025 as producers like Glencore PLC expand mines, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd. By 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was last year, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates. \\u201cThere are lot of grand plans being put in place by automotive manufacturers, but not many of them seem to have considered the cobalt-supply chain,\\u201d Gavin Montgomery, director of cross-commodity analytics at Wood Mackenzie in London, said in an interview. Few commodity markets are so dominated by one supplier, and that presents a problem for the world\\u2019s automakers. Cobalt is a byproduct of copper and nickel mining. Until recently, there were often surplus supplies as it was used mostly to harden steel, but the bluish-gray metal\\u2019s ability to efficiently conduct electricity has made it essential for high-end rechargeable batteries. A typical power unit in an electric car contains about 15kg of cobalt, though some varieties use less than 5kg. Over the next two decades, the global fleet of electric vehicles may reach 282 million, or about 16 percent of all cars on the road, BNEF analysts estimate. Tesla Inc has more than doubled vehicle unit sales since 2014, and is targeting 500,000 for next year. Volkswagen AG plans to invest 20 billion euros (US$24 billion) by 2030 to roll out electric vehicles, with another 50 billion euros earmarked for batteries. Volvo Car AB says it will have five electric models in its lineup by 2021, while Daimler AG, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, is investing US$1 billion to ramp up electric-vehicle production in the US With demand growing, mining companies including Glencore, Eurasian Natural Resources Corp and China Molybdenum Co are pouring more money into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has by far the most proven reserves. While the country has been a reliable producer for more than a decade, it is still recovering from a brutal civil war that cost millions of lives and crippled the mining industry before peace arrived in 2003. DR Congo President Joseph Kabila \\u2014 whose father seized control of the country after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 only to be assassinated four years later \\u2014 refused to give up power after his term expired last year. Since taking over in 2001, the 46-year-old Kabila and his family have built a vast business network that reaches every corner of the economy, including mining interests. Most of the country\\u2019s export income comes from mining. Comments will be moderated.

       "       \"content\": \"Tech giants sued over deaths of children working in cobalt mines Inside your phone, your laptop, your computer is likely a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. And inside that battery is cobalt, a metallic element that is coveted for its magnetism, hardness, and ability to resist extreme heat and corrosion. Given the growing number of devices in the world, the demand for this element is at an all-time high \\u2014 and the conditions for workers who are tasked with retrieving it can be deadly. Now, for the first time ever, technology firms that rely on lithium-ion batteries to power the devices they sell all over the world may be held to account for causalities in cobalt mines. Earlier this week, the human rights organization on behalf of 14 Congolese families whose children were killed or severely injured while illegally working in cobalt mines. The legal action names Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla, and Google's parent company, Alphabet as defendants, and marks one of the first legal attempts to hold companies accountable for the child labor that is utilized within their supply chain. has reached out to the companies named in the lawsuit for comment. A spokesperson for Google responded, stating, \\\"Child labor and endangerment is unacceptable and our Supplier Code of Conduct strictly prohibits this activity. We are committed to sourcing all materials ethically and eliminating child mining in global supply chains. As an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we work alongside our suppliers, other companies, and industry groups to drive efforts in and beyond the DRC.\\\" A representative from Apple told Mic, \\\"Apple is deeply committed to the chain to the mine level and since 2016, we have published a full list of our identified cobalt refiners every year, 100 percent of which are participating in independent third party audits. If a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. We\\u2019ve removed 6 cobalt refiners in 2019.\\u201d The class-action suit specifically claims that the tech giants \\\"aided and abetted\\\" a system that encouraged and in some cases even forced children into unsafe working conditions. International Rights Advocates believes the companies had \\\"specific knowledge\\\" of the fact that children work in cobalt mines but did nothing to stop that from happening despite commitments to do so \\u2014 all in the name of ensuring their profit margins didn't shrink. Every company named in the lawsuit claims to not utilize child labor in their respective supply chain. However, in 2014, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that there are an estimated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), digging for metals like cobalt to be used in lithium-ion batteries. The Congo is not alone in this practice \\u2014 the reported on similarly lax practices that \\u2014 but the country has become a hotbed of mining because of the presence of cobalt within its land. A report last year found that more than half of the world's supply of cobalt comes from mines in the DRC, and about 20 percent of that is mined by hand. Much of the mining is so-called \\\"artisanal\\\" mining, which happens outside of the scope of traditional mining companies. These operations often utilize the labor of children and do not adhere to any of the practices meant to ensure the safety of workers. were found to be working in some of these artisanal mining operations. These practices lead to miserable working conditions for those digging up the cobalt and other metals. According to the complaint filed by International Rights Advocates, many working the dangerous and physically exhausting jobs are paid as little as $2 per day. In exchange, they are exposed to life-threatening conditions on the regular. Earlier this year, a , leaving as many as 43 dead and many others missing or injured. In some cases, children and others are Many tech companies have worked to try to push these illegal and dangerous practices out of their supply chain. Last year, Apple announced a plan to so it could keep a closer eye on the practices taking place in the mine and ensure that child labor is not being exploited to dig up cobalt. It was also the only company to comply with a that looked at the suppliers of cobalt that tech companies utilize. Still, most companies \\u2014 Apple included \\u2014 appear to be falling short of their own stated goals of removing child labor from their supply chain. Perhaps the legal action from International Rights Advocates will more meaningfully hold them to account. \",\n",

       "       \"content\": \"Child labor taints production of electric cars: Amnesty Leading electric car makers might be unwittingly using child labor to produce batteries for vehicles that have grown in popularity for using \\u201cclean\\u201d energy aimed at limiting global warming, Amnesty International said yesterday. The human rights watchdog said cobalt used in lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles, phones and laptops could come from mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) that use child labor. It accused car makers including General Motors Co, Renault-Nissan, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and Tesla Motors Inc of failing to map the supply of cobalt from mines in the DR Congo to smelters and on to batterymakers. As a result, electric cars sold across the globe could contain traces of the metal produced each year by informal Congolese mines without companies knowing, the group said. \\u201cWe have found that there is significant risk that cobalt mined by children could be entering their supply chains,\\u201d Amnesty human rights researcher Mark Dummett said. Due to the growing demand for lithium ion batteries in electric cars and consumer goods like mobile phones, Dummett said automakers have an obligation to trace their supply chain to ensure children were not used to mine cobalt. \\u201cFrankly companies owe it to their consumer to be transparent about their supplies and to map out their supply chains so that they know where it\\u2019s coming from,\\u201d he said. More than half of the world\\u2019s cobalt comes from the DR Congo, Amnesty said, and 20 percent of the mineral is mined by hand. The DR Congo\\u2019s supply of metals such as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold has been under scrutiny since 2010, when laws in the US required US-listed companies to ensure their supply chain was free from these so-called \\u201cconflict minerals.\\u201d Cobalt has received scant regulatory attention, although the DR Congo, where dozens of armed groups roam its lawless eastern region, is the source of more than half of global supply. VW told reporters it was investigating whether cobalt in their electric car batteries was mined in the DR Congo. \\u201cTo our best knowledge, the cobalt in our batteries does not originate from the respective sources from DRC [DR Congo]. To our best knowledge we had no human rights abuses in our cobalt supply chain,\\u201d VW spokeswoman Leslie Bothge said. Tesla said there was \\u201cvery little\\u201d cobalt in its batteries, adding that going deep into their supply chain to investigate the use of child labor was \\u201cboth unusual and challenging.\\u201d \\u201cWe have asked the company in the DRC [DR Congo] that produces this trace amount of cobalt deep down within our supply chain to provide written documentation directly to us concerning their practices,\\u201d Tesla spokesman Alexis Georgeson said. \\u201cThat documentation confirms that child or compulsory labor or human trafficking are prohibited.\\u201d GM said in a statement it has a \\u201czero-tolerance policy\\u201d on child labor and other unethical business practices, requiring written compliance from its suppliers, while Daimler said it was investigating the \\u201cprocesses and measures taken by our suppliers to prevent such alleged practices in their upstream supply chains.\\u201d Dummett said although many electric car makers had human rights policies, they were not willing to publicly disclose the steps they were taking, if any, to actively prevent child labor in their supply chains.

       "       \"content\": \"Exclusive: China's Lishen plans first European sales office for electric vehicle batteries - source LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Chinese battery maker Tianjin Lishen plans to open a sales office in Germany, its first in Europe, and is in talks to supply local auto makers with batteries used to power electric vehicles, a source at the company told Reuters. Two sources said Volkswagen , the world's largest car maker, and Daimler are negotiating with unlisted Tianjin Lishen Battery. A source close to Volkswagen said the company is in advanced talks with Tianjin Lishen on lithium-ion battery supply contracts, but agreements have not yet been signed. Asked for comment, a VW spokeswoman said \\\"there is nothing to say at present on this topic\\\". Daimler declined comment. No-one at Tianjin Lishen was immediately available to comment. Auto makers around the world have in recent months laid out bold plans for massive investments in electric vehicles (EVs), where demand is accelerating due to government moves to cut noxious fumes from fossil-fueled cars. They are buying lithium-ion rechargeable batteries used to power electric vehicles from multiple producers to diversify their supply chains, the source at Tianjin Lishen Battery said. Volkswagen has picked partners to provide battery cells and related technology worth around 20 billion euros ($24.5 billion), while Daimler aims for 100,000 annual EV sales by 2020. Any new office would be located near Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen has its headquarters, the source at Tianjin said, declining to give more specific detail. \\\"We are considering setting up an office in Germany. It will be a sales office not a factory,\\\" the source at Lishen said. \\\"We are negotiating with VW and Daimler. We have sent samples to these carmakers and are waiting for the next stage - mass production.\\\" Volkswagen has a goal of selling 3 million electric cars per year across the group by 2025 and to offer an electric version of each of the group's 300 models by 2030. Concerns about shortages of cobalt -- used to make the batteries -- from untainted sources have prompted carmakers to take steps to secure supplies for the longer term. VW last year asked producers to submit proposals on supplying cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019. Former VW chief executive Matthias Mueller recently said that Korean firms LG Chem and Samsung and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) will provide batteries for the firm. European auto makers typically have to source from Asia because Chinese, Korean and Japanese firms dominate the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries. Lishen on its website lists China Electronic Technology Group (CETC), a state-owned firm managed by the central government, as its biggest shareholder. China is aggressively promoting electric vehicles to help combat smog and to position the country as a car-making giant of the future. Some 777,000 so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) were sold in China in 2017, a jump of 53 percent on the year and the most sold in any one country. Beijing aims to bring annual sales to 2 million units by 2020. Beijing is also working to promote its own standards and benchmarks for electric and plug-in electric vehicles overseas, taking advantage of economies of scale to become a global leader in standardization.

       "       \"content\": \"Sweden hunts cobalt for electric vehicles Sweden is to step up efforts to find precious minerals such as cobalt and lithium, key battery components that are increasingly in demand among makers of electric vehicles. The government is to invest 10 million kronor (US$1.26 million) over the next two years to map the existence of minerals deemed important for growth. While Sweden has a history of mining for base metals, the Geological Survey of Sweden, a government agency, believes there is potential for expanding the output of more uncommon minerals like tungsten and rare earths. \\u201cSweden has unique assets in its bedrock,\\u201d Swedish Enterprise Minister Mikael Damberg said in a telephone interview on Thursday. \\u201cHistorically we have mainly explored minerals such as copper, iron, silver and gold, but the shift to green technologies means there\\u2019s an increased need for other minerals.\\u201d The plan is part of a global push to safeguard the supply of critical metals and reduce the world\\u2019s dependence on the Democratic Republic of the Congo for cobalt. The conflict-ridden African country currently produces the vast majority of cobalt, often in small mining operations where injuries and child labor are common. The price of cobalt, a key component in the manufacture of electric vehicles, has more than tripled since the start of 2016. If each of the 1 billion cars currently on the road were to be replaced with a Tesla Model X, demand for cobalt would equal 14 million tonnes \\u2014 twice the size of the current global reserves, according to a study by commodity analysts CRU Group. Even a more realistic scenario of 30 million electric cars by 2030 would require output to be more than trebled from current levels. As manufacturers position themselves for a post-fossil fuel world, Sweden\\u2019s Volvo Cars recently announced plans to make all of its new models electric from next year. In addition to the government-funded initiative, Sweden has also seen a rise in private investment in the exploration of minerals used in batteries. One is Australia\\u2019s Talga Resources, which runs exploration activities aiming to extract cobalt and graphite in northern Sweden. In a recent update, it said base metal deposits in Sweden have \\u201csignificant potential\\u201d as a future supply of cobalt for batteries. The Geological Survey of Sweden has a collection of 18,000 core samples, some of them dating back to 1858, that can be analyzed for traces of materials that have previously been overlooked. It is also to look at waste material from existing base metals mines. Comments will be moderated.

       "       \"content\": \"Car industry: What's the real cost of going electric? Under pressure from trade tariffs, new CO2 rules and even Brexit, carmakers around the world are electrifying. Back in 1888, the electric car was all the rage. But the discovery of large petroleum reserves worldwide and the combustion engine quickly killed it off. Electrification was very much the theme at this year's Geneva Motor Show, but consumers are yet to be convinced. Of the 80 million cars expected to be sold this year, just two million will be electric. However, that's not stopping the big carmakers from making the switch. So what is the future of the automotive industry? What will it take to go electric? And what will be the real cost of it? Economics editor Abid Ali caught up with Linda Jackson, the CEO of Citroen, at the Geneva Motor Show. He began by asking her if electric cars - which take fewer people to assemble - catch on, then what will that mean for jobs. \\\"I don't know whether it's the question of whether it'll take less people to make the car, it's about how many manufacturers will be able to afford to make the cars and how many of our customers will be able to buy our cars because electric cars do mean that potentially that'll be an increase in price. So there's very many factors playing in effect in terms of what the future is for the automotive industry.\\\" China has the lead. Clearly, every manufacturer is trying to find ways to support the supply of batteries in the future because that's absolutely fundamental. According to Jackson, an important consideration is \\\"the infrastructure that we need to be able to run them and move about in our electric cars, so that's another factor that'll impact our society\\\". \\\"Customers aren't reluctant to buy it, but they're keen on making sure that they're able to use their cars, charge their cars, to be able to charge them while they're on the move - and that's something that hasn't really been considered, generally. Apart from that, everything will be able for customers but we have to realise that the cost of the batteries, etc will mean there's increment for having an electric car, and I'm not sure all customers realise that there will be an increment.\\\" In terms of the availability of batteries, \\\"China has the lead. Clearly, every manufacturer is trying to find ways to support the supply of batteries in the future because that's absolutely fundamental ... but China is in a very strong position and in terms of their own market, is moving very quickly towards electric and wanting to encourage electric, obviously on the back of the fact that they're the major battery supplier,\\\" says Jackson. \\\"Clearly it's a major concern and question for all manufacturers to be able to find solutions and ensure that we have the continued supply of batteries in the future.\\\" Five million young people will be entering the job market every year for the next five years in the Middle East.

Climate change mitigation will create new natural resource and supply chain opportunities and dilemmas, because substantial amounts of raw materials will be required to build new low-carbon energy devices and infrastructure ( ). However, despite attempts at improved governance and better corporate management, procurement of many mineral and metal resources occurs in areas generally acknowledged for mismanagement, remains environmentally capricious, and, in some cases, is a source of conflict at the sites of resource extraction ( ). These extractive and smelting industries have thus left a legacy in many parts of the world of environmental degradation, adverse impacts to public health, marginalized communities and workers, and biodiversity damage. We identify key sustainability challenges with practices used in industries that will supply the metals and minerals\\u2014including cobalt, copper, lithium, cadmium, and rare earth elements (REEs)\\u2014needed for technologies such as solar photovoltaics, batteries, electric vehicle (EV) motors, wind turbines, fuel cells, and nuclear reactors.

       "       \"content\": \"Battery \\u2018mining\\u2019 a new cobalt source for electric cars Almost 14,500km from the dusty Congo savanna, miners have hit on an entirely new source of cobalt \\u2014 the rare mineral at the heart of the electric-car boom \\u2014 and not only can they take coffee breaks, when they take a break, they can grab a donut at Tim Hortons. Scientists working for American Manganese Inc, located in the suburbs of Vancouver, have developed a way to produce enough of the bluish-gray metal to power all the electric cars on the road today without drilling into the ground: by recycling faulty batteries. It is one of many technologies that entrepreneurs are patenting to prepare for a time when electric cars outnumber combustion engines, turning the entire automotive supply chain upside down in the process. Instead of radiators, spark plugs and fuel injectors, the industry will need cheap sources of cobalt, copper and lithium. \\u201cMining batteries is much more profitable than mining the ground,\\u201d said Larry Reaugh, the president of American Manganese, which is patenting a method to draw out all of the metals in rechargeable batteries. \\u201cRather than mining ore that\\u2019s 2 percent cobalt, you\\u2019re mining a battery that has 100 percent cobalt in it.\\u201d Innovators like him have made so much progress that the likes of Tesla Motors Inc and Toyota Motor Corp could count on recycling for 10 percent of their battery material needs through 2025 if companies roll out large schemes, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That will ease pressure on lithium and cobalt, whose prices have more than doubled over the past year. Finding new sources of cobalt, in particular, could be a game-changer, because more than half of the relatively rare metal is sourced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not only is it one of the world\\u2019s poorest countries, doing business there is tough after decades of violence and corruption. Some artisanal mines still use child labor. American Manganese wants to recycle the one in 10 lithium-ion batteries \\u2014 used in everything from home electronics to smartphones \\u2014 that fail quality-control tests and end up in hazardous-waste dumps. Doing this could yield as much as 4,000 tonnes of cobalt, Reaugh said. If true, that is equal to the material used in all electric vehicles on the road this year. Add in the 311,000 tonnes of electric car batteries that Bloomberg New Energy Finance anticipates will stop working by 2025, and the potential trove of metals grows exponentially. Recycling could have a \\u201cstabilizing effect\\u201d on battery metal prices, said George Heppel, a consultant at London-based commodity analysis company CRU Ltd. After surging from US$10 to US$30 a pound in less than two years, cobalt\\u2019s price gains are poised to slow to US$32 by 2021 and US$41 by 2022, according to forecasts of Macquarie Group Ltd, one of the largest banks in commodities. Pressure on lithium, sourced mainly from Chilean brine lakes, will also abate as new supply starts getting produced in Argentina and Australia. \\u201cRecycling will help to ease supply constraints that we see coming in the next couple of years,\\u201d Bloomberg New Energy Finance energy storage analyst James Frith said. \\u201cIt will be a big deal mainly because you wouldn\\u2019t get all the wastage going into the ground.\\u201d That does not mean miners like Glencore PLC, the world\\u2019s top producer, will need to scale back production. As the number of electric cars on roads from Shanghai to Paris surges from 2 million now to 118 million vehicles by 2030, demand for cobalt will soar to 156,000 tonnes. Comments will be moderated.

The suit, filed this week in Washington by the nongovernmental organization International Rights Advocates, seeks damages from Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Cobalt is an essential element in the rechargeable lithium batteries that fuel many electronic devices. The rise of smartphones in the past 20 years has created a large demand for the metal, and the growing popularity of electric cars is expected to further increase demand. The lawsuit claims the companies are \\u201caiding and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young children\\u201d in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The lawsuit targets a pair of mining companies, the British-based firm Glencore and the Chinese company Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, which it says supply cobalt to all the defendants. The suit is filed on behalf of 13 anonymous plaintiffs, all families with children who died or suffered serious injury while mining cobalt. The suit claims that the cobalt boom \\u201cbrought on a new wave of brutal exploitation\\u201d for the DRC, which has a bloody colonial history and was once considered the personal property of Belgium's King Leopold II. It says hundreds of Congolese children have been forced by extreme poverty to work in the cobalt mines, digging in underground tunnels with primitive equipment for as little as $2 per day. A statement from Apple said the company is \\u201cdeeply committed to the responsible sourcing of materials that go into our products.\\u201d It says the company \\u201cremoved\\u201d six cobalt refiners from its supply chain in 2019 for being unable to meet Apple's safety standards. A Dell statement says the allegations in the lawsuit are being investigated and declares that the company has \\u201cnever knowingly sourced operations using any form of involuntary labor, fraudulent recruiting practices or child labor.\\u201d A Google statement says, \\u201cChild labor and endangerment is unacceptable and our Supplier Code of Conduct strictly prohibits this activity.\\u201d The other companies named in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      " (at left) a colorized electron micrograph image of the influenza virus. (at right) color-enhanced electron micrograph image of sars-cov-2 virus particles, isolated from a patient. the fact that the novel coronavirus appeared in the middle of flu season has prompted inevitable comparisons. is covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, pretty much similar to the flu or does it pose a far greater threat?  although there are still many unknowns about covid-19, there is some solid information from researchers that sheds light on some of the similarities and differences at this time. symptoms fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. these are the most frequent symptoms of covid-19. some patients might develop aches and pains; just 5% get the sniffles, according to data from china — indicating that covid-19 is not usually an upper respiratory infection.  these are all symptoms that overlap with flu. the centers for disease control and prevention says that anyone who is experiencing these symptoms and who has been in direct contact with a confirmed covid-19 patient, or who lives in an area where cases are circulating, should call their doctor for advice. transmission flu and the coronavirus are both thought to be spread primarily through close contact with droplets expelled from the nose and mouth of a sick person. you can become infected by direct contact such as kissing but also by close talking with someone who's infected. the cdc recommends keeping a physical distance of about 6 feet from others. you can also pick up flu or the coronavirus if you touch a tabletop or phone that was coughed on, but not disinfected, in the past few hours or days, then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.  data from china show that each coronavirus case seems to infect about 2 to 2.5 additional people. that's higher than the flu. the average patient spreads the flu virus to about 1.3 others.  new research suggests that the higher number of infections per coronavirus patient may be related to the frequency of presymptomatic transmission — when people who have been infected are not yet showing symptoms but in fact could be contagious. an analysis of data from china found that 13% of cases were likely caused by people spreading the coronavirus before they started coughing and feeling achy.  by contrast, flu is most contagious in the three or four days after symptoms begin, according to the cdc, and presymptomatic transmission doesn't seem to be a major driver of new cases.  it's also possible that the coronavirus can be transmitted by other methods. researchers are trying to determine, for example, whether tiny droplets can stay suspended in the air in contagious doses, or if fecal matter can be a source of infection. degree of mild vs. severe cases about 80% of coronavirus cases are mild to moderate, which ranges from having a fever and a cough to low-grade pneumonia. it might still be miserable, but you can heal up on your couch at home. data from china show that 20% of covid-19 patients, though, are serious enough to get sent to the hospital. that's about 10 times more often than flu. even though a great many people are hospitalized for the flu — the preliminary data for the 2018-19 flu season is nearly half a million — the rate of hospitalization is far lower: 1%-2% of cases, according to the cdc.  for the coronavirus, \"what's particularly concerning are the number of people who are progressing to need hospital level care and then eventually critical care and who are dying, especially at the extremes of [older] age,\" says dr. parker hudson, an epidemiologist at university of texas at austin's dell medical school. people who are over 60 and who have other health problems are more at risk of severe illness and hospitalization — for both covid-19 and flu.  length of hospitalization once a patient with a serious case of the coronavirus is hospitalized, the average stay is 11 days, according to a study based on january data from wuhan — about twice as long as the five- to six-day average stay for flu. the additional days mean additional stresses on the health care system. \"to take care of intensive, really unwell people can often require two to three medical staff at one time, all in protective gear, for hours and hours,\" says michael ryan, director of the world health organization's health emergencies program. that's a big strain on our nurses and doctors and hospitals, and it's overlapping with flu season, which generally ends by may. from early october through the beginning of march, the cdc estimates that between 370,000 and 670,000 people were hospitalized with flu.  what percentage of the population will get each virus? there are years of data that can answer that question for influenza. in the u.s., for example, in recent years about 8.3% of the total population get sick from flu each season, a cdc study found; including people who carry the flu virus but show no symptoms, that estimate ranges to up to 20%.  nobody knows what percentage of the population will eventually contract the coronavirus., but there are some educated guesses. since this is a new disease and there's no vaccine and no established immunity from past cycles, experts believe everyone is susceptible.  a march 19 letter from researchers at the university of hong kong and harvard, published in nature medicine, predicted that globally, \"at least one-quarter to one-half of the population will very likely become infected, absent drastic control measures or a vaccine.\" an influential modeling analysis released march 16 from imperial college of london predicted a worse-case scenario in which 81% of the u.s. population could get infected over the next few months, if no actions were taken to slow or contain the spread of the virus. predictions from models like this appear to have spurred u.s. officials to implement social distancing measures to combat the virus's spread. to come up with better data for covid-19 infection rates, researchers are doing blood tests in china to see how many people have been infected in a place where the epidemic appears to have been successfully suppressed through efforts such as lockdowns, contact tracing and an increase in hospital capacity.  death rate initial data show that the coronavirus is deadlier. in the u.s., seasonal flu kills 1 in a thousand people (0.1%) who get sick from it — the death toll last season was more than 34,000. worldwide, an estimated 300,000 to 650,000 people die from flu each year.  by contrast, covid-19 is currently estimated to kill at least 10 people per thousand infected (1%). \"it's about 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu,\" said dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institutes of allergy and infectious disease, in congressional testimony on march 11. more data is needed to assess the covid-19 death rate, including detailed figures on how many cases present with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. so far, covid-19 has killed about 10,000 people worldwide — and about 200 in the u.s. but infectious disease specialists warn that, if the coronavirus spreads widely in the u.s., the numbers could rise quickly. \"it does have the potential to be just as bad, if not worse, in terms of the overall number of deaths and severe cases as seasonal flu,\" says angela rasmussen, a virologist at columbia university.  treatment rest and supportive care are the common treatments for both flu and for coronavirus cases that don't require hospitalization. for flu, which has been studied intensively, doctors have some additional tools to fight it, says dr. meghan freeman, an infectious disease fellow at the upmc children's hospital of pittsburgh. a drug called tamiflu aims to stop the flu virus from replicating in the body and can lessen the severity of symptoms. other treatments that prime the body's immune system are in development. there are no approved treatments for covid-19 yet, though researchers are racing to see if pills for other ailments could work against the coronavirus, and to develop specific therapies that would lessen symptoms and hasten recovery.  existing medications are being evaluated in the u.s., china and other countries. \"it is likely that we will know if they work in the next several months,\" said fauci, director of the niaid, in congressional testimony on march 11. drugs under consideration include remdesevir, an experimental drug originally developed for ebola, and an anti-malarial called chloroquine, according to who. vaccines for vaccines that could prevent covid-19, fauci said it will take at least a year to a year and a half for a vaccine to be available to the public. vaccine development requires a multistage process of human trials. \"it will take three or four months to determine if [a vaccine option] is safe,\" he said, and at least another eight months to gauge whether it's effective. the first u.s. vaccine clinical trials started on monday, the national institutes of health announced. modern flu vaccines were first developed in the 1930s and protected u.s. troops against the flu during world war ii. a new vaccine is developed each year to combat the latest flu strains. this flu season, the cdc says that about 160 million to 170 million flu shots were shipped out — enough to cover about half the u.s. population. impact of seasonal weather while flu cases are found year-round, the flu does wane when the weather gets warm. in the u.s., each flu season varies, but the number of new flu cases tends to peak between december and february and tail off by the month of may.  researchers think it has to do with how people spend more time outside when it's warmer, and how higher heat and humidity can cause some viruses to decay more quickly. they're also studying how the immune system may fluctuate with the seasons and exposure to sunlight.  but dr. bruce aylward, an adviser to who, says don't count on a similar pattern for covid-19, which is thriving in warm, tropical places: \"it's roaring in singapore. it's not flu season in singapore. it's roaring in the southern part of china. it's not flu season.\"  researchers will only know whether the coronavirus follows flu patterns by seeing whether infections decline as the seasons change. there's the possibility that it won't, so in the meantime, aylward thinks hospitals should prepare as though covid-19 is here to stay as a year-round health threat. npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor\n"
